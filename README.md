**Routing**

Routing is a very essential part of a Web Application. CogentPHP has an simple yet elegant way of handling routing.

	We are going to explain this With an Example.

	- accountController.php

	<?php

	/** Autoloading The required Classes **/

	use Core\Core\C_Base;
	use Core\Core\Redirect;

	class IndexController extends C_Base
	  {
	  	function __construct( $tile )
	  	{
	      /** Loading the corresponding Model class **/
	  		$this->model = new $tile;
	  	}

	  	public function index()
	  	{
	      /** Initializing a index.html view Found in (Views/index.html) **/
	      Init::view('index');
	  	}

			public function pay()
	  	{
	      /** Initializing a index.html view Found in (Views/index.html) **/
	      Init::view('index');
	  	}

			public function withdraw()
	  	{
	      /** Initializing a index.html view Found in (Views/index.html) **/
	      Init::view('index');
	  	}

	}
	 ?>

To generate URL from the Above controller, We have

	localhost/account/
		The URL Maps to accountController -> index()
		Since no Method is Specified in URL, It maps it to index method by default.

	localhost/account/pay
	 	This URL Maps to accountController -> pay()
	localhost/account/withdraw
	 	This URL Maps to accountController -> withdraw()
	localhost/account/begin
	 	This results in a 404 error, Because the method begin() doesn't exist in the Class


	The URL is Case Insensitive as:

	accountController -> withdrawMoney() ==

	1. localhost/account/withdrawmoney
	2. localhost/account/withdrawMoney

		They Both Evaluate to the same Method
